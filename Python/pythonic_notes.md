# Pythonic Code: Elegant and Readable Patterns

## Unpacking and Packing

- **Unpacking:** Assign multiple variables at once from iterables.
  ```python
  a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
  x, *rest = [10, 20, 30, 40]  # x=10, rest=[20,30,40]
  first, *_, last = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # first=1, last=4
  ```
- **Packing:** Use \*args and \*\*kwargs to collect positional and keyword arguments in functions.
  ```python
  def func(*args, **kwargs):
    pass
  ```

## Enumerate for Readability

- Use `enumerate()` to get both index and value when looping.
  ```python
  for idx, value in enumerate(my_list):
      print(idx, value)
  ```
- Improves clarity and avoids manual index tracking.

## Zip for Parallel Iteration

- Use `zip()` to iterate over multiple iterables in parallel.
  ```python
  for a, b in zip(list1, list2):
      print(a, b)
  ```
- Useful for combining, comparing, or processing paired data.

## Chained Comparisons

- Python allows concise chained comparisons:
  ```python
  if 0 < x < 10:
      ...
  ```

## Min/Max Shortcuts

- Use `min()` and `max()` to constrain values elegantly:
  ```python
  transactions = max(0, transactions)  # Never negative
  transactions = min(100, transactions)  # Never above 100
  ```
- Prefer these over verbose if-statements for bounds checking.

## General Tips

- Prefer list comprehensions for concise transformations.
- Use generator expressions for memory efficiency with large data.
- Leverage built-in functions (`any`, `all`, `sum`, `sorted`, etc.) for clarity and performance.
- Write expressive, readable codeâ€”avoid unnecessary loops and manual bookkeeping.

## Python Lists: Powerful and Versatile

Lists are ordered, mutable collections of items. They are one of Python's most versatile built-in data types.

### Creating Lists

```python
# Empty list
empty_list = []
empty_list_alt = list()

# List with initial elements
my_list = [1, 2, 3, "hello", 3.14]

# List from an iterable (e.g., string, tuple, range)
list_from_string = list("python")  # ['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n']
list_from_range = list(range(5))   # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Accessing and Slicing Elements

Elements are accessed by their index (0-based). Slicing extracts a portion of the list.

```python
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
first_element = my_list[0]   # 10
second_element = my_list[1]  # 20
last_element = my_list[-1]   # 50

# Slicing: list[start:stop:step]
sub_list = my_list[1:4]    # [20, 30, 40] (elements at index 1, 2, 3)
from_start = my_list[:3]   # [10, 20, 30]
to_end = my_list[2:]       # [30, 40, 50]
every_other = my_list[::2] # [10, 30, 50]
reversed_list = my_list[::-1]# [50, 40, 30, 20, 10] (creates a new reversed list)
```

### Modifying Lists

#### Adding Elements

- `append(x)`: Adds item `x` to the end of the list.
- `insert(i, x)`: Inserts item `x` at a given position `i`.
- `extend(iterable)`: Extends the list by appending all items from the iterable.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers.append(4)          # numbers is now [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.insert(1, 99)      # numbers is now [1, 99, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.extend([5, 6])     # numbers is now [1, 99, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

#### Removing Elements

- `remove(x)`: Removes the first item from the list whose value is equal to `x`. Raises `ValueError` if `x` is not found.
- `pop([i])`: Removes the item at the given position `i` in the list and returns it. If no index is specified, `pop()` removes and returns the last item.
- `clear()`: Removes all items from the list (equivalent to `del a[:]`).

```python
items = [10, 20, 30, 20, 40]
items.remove(20)           # items is now [10, 30, 20, 40] (first 20 removed)
popped_item = items.pop(1) # popped_item is 30, items is now [10, 20, 40]
last_item = items.pop()    # last_item is 40, items is now [10, 20]
items.clear()              # items is now []
```

### Other Common List Methods

- `index(x[, start[, end]])`: Returns the zero-based index in the list of the first item whose value is `x`. Raises `ValueError` if `x` is not found.
  Optional `start` and `end` arguments limit the search to a subsequence.
- `count(x)`: Returns the number of times `x` appears in the list.
- `sort(key=None, reverse=False)`: Sorts the items of the list in place. `key` and `reverse` are customization options.
- `reverse()`: Reverses the elements of the list in place.
- `copy()`: Returns a shallow copy of the list (equivalent to `a[:]`).

```python
data = [5, 2, 7, 1, 0, 12, 5, 3]
print(f"Index of 7: {data.index(7)}")      # Output: Index of 7: 2
print(f"Count of 5: {data.count(5)}")      # Output: Count of 5: 2

data_copy = data.copy()
print(f"Original data: {data}")
print(f"Copied data: {data_copy}")

data.sort()
print(f"Sorted data: {data}")            # Output: Sorted data: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 12]
data.sort(reverse=True)
print(f"Reverse sorted data: {data}")    # Output: Reverse sorted data: [12, 7, 5, 5, 3, 2, 1, 0]

data.reverse()
print(f"Reversed data: {data}")          # Output: Reversed data: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 5, 7, 12] (reversed from previous state)
```

**Note on `sort()` vs `sorted()`**: `list.sort()` sorts the list in-place (modifies the original list and returns `None`). The built-in function `sorted(iterable)` returns a new sorted list, leaving the original iterable unchanged.

### List Comprehensions: Concise List Creation

List comprehensions provide a compact way to create lists. The general syntax is: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`

#### Basic Comprehension

```python
# Squares of numbers from 0 to 9
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
# squares: [0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

#### Comprehension with a Condition

```python
# Even numbers from 0 to 9
evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# evens: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

#### Comprehension with Function Calls

```python
def to_uppercase(s):
    return s.upper()

words = ["hello", "world"]
uppercase_words = [to_uppercase(word) for word in words]
# uppercase_words: ['HELLO', 'WORLD']

# Using lambda functions
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
doubled = [(lambda x: x * 2)(num) for num in numbers] # Or more simply: [num * 2 for num in numbers]
# doubled: [2, 4, 6, 8]
```

#### Nested List Comprehensions

For creating lists of lists or iterating over multiple iterables.

```python
# Create a 3x3 matrix (list of lists)
matrix = [[(row, col) for col in range(3)] for row in range(3)]
# matrix: [[(0,0), (0,1), (0,2)], [(1,0), (1,1), (1,2)], [(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)]]

# Flatten a list of lists
list_of_lists = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
flattened = [item for sublist in list_of_lists for item in sublist]
# flattened: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Pairs from two lists (Cartesian product)
list1 = ['a', 'b']
list2 = [1, 2]
pairs = [(x, y) for x in list1 for y in list2]
# pairs: [('a', 1), ('a', 2), ('b', 1), ('b', 2)]
```

#### Comprehensions with `enumerate`

To get both index and value.

```python
my_items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
indexed_items = [(index, value) for index, value in enumerate(my_items)]
# indexed_items: [(0, 'apple'), (1, 'banana'), (2, 'cherry')]
```

#### Comprehensions with `zip`

To iterate over multiple iterables in parallel.

```python
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [30, 25, 35]
name_age_pairs = [(name, age) for name, age in zip(names, ages)]
# name_age_pairs: [('Alice', 30), ('Bob', 25), ('Charlie', 35)]
```

### Using Lists with `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`

While list comprehensions are often more Pythonic for `map` and `filter` operations, these functions are still useful.

- **`map(function, iterable, ...)`**: Applies `function` to every item of `iterable` and returns an iterator of the results.

  ```python
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  # Using map
  squared_map = list(map(lambda x: x**2, numbers)) # [1, 4, 9, 16]
  # Equivalent list comprehension
  squared_lc = [x**2 for x in numbers]
  ```

- **`filter(function, iterable)`**: Constructs an iterator from elements of `iterable` for which `function` returns true.

  ```python
  numbers = range(10)
  # Using filter
  evens_filter = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers)) # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
  # Equivalent list comprehension
  evens_lc = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
  ```

- **`functools.reduce(function, iterable[, initializer])`**: Applies `function` of two arguments cumulatively to the items of `iterable`, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single value.
  ```python
  from functools import reduce
  numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  sum_of_numbers = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, numbers) # 15
  # Using built-in sum() is more direct for this case: sum(numbers)
  ```

### Related Comprehension Types

Python also supports comprehensions for other data types:

- **Set Comprehensions**: ` {expression for item in iterable if condition}`
  ```python
  unique_squares = {x**2 for x in [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]}
  # unique_squares: {1, 4, 9, 16}
  ```
- **Dictionary Comprehensions**: `{key_expression: value_expression for item in iterable if condition}`
  ```python
  squared_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
  # squared_dict: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}
  ```

This concludes the refined section on Python lists.

## Python Dictionaries (Hashmaps): Key-Value Powerhouses

Dictionaries, often called hashmaps in other languages, are fundamental data structures in Python. They store data as collections of key-value pairs. Each key must be unique and immutable (e.g., strings, numbers, tuples), while values can be of any data type and can be duplicated. Dictionaries are unordered in Python versions before 3.7, but are insertion-ordered by default from Python 3.7 onwards.

### Creating Dictionaries

```python
# Empty dictionary
empty_dict = {}
empty_dict_alt = dict()

# Dictionary with initial key-value pairs
my_dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Creating a dictionary using the dict() constructor
# From a list of key-value tuples
dict_from_tuples = dict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)]) # {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

# From keyword arguments (keys must be valid identifiers)
dict_from_kwargs = dict(name="Bob", age=25) # {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}

# Using zip to combine keys and values lists
keys = ['fruit', 'color', 'quantity']
values = ['apple', 'red', 5]
dict_from_zip = dict(zip(keys, values)) # {'fruit': 'apple', 'color': 'red', 'quantity': 5}
```

### Accessing Values

Values are accessed using their corresponding keys.

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Using square bracket notation
name = my_dict["name"]  # Alice
# If key doesn't exist, it raises a KeyError
# city = my_dict["city"] # Raises KeyError

# Using the get() method
age = my_dict.get("age")      # 30
city = my_dict.get("city")    # None (returns None if key is not found)
country = my_dict.get("country", "Unknown") # Unknown (returns default value if key not found)
```

Using `get()` is often safer as it avoids `KeyError` exceptions for missing keys.

### Adding and Updating Key-Value Pairs

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice"}

# Adding a new key-value pair
my_dict["age"] = 30            # my_dict is now {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}

# Updating an existing key's value
my_dict["name"] = "Alicia"     # my_dict is now {'name': 'Alicia', 'age': 30}

# Using the update() method
# Can add multiple pairs or update existing ones
my_dict.update({"city": "London", "age": 31})
# my_dict is now {'name': 'Alicia', 'age': 31, 'city': 'London'}

# update() can also take another dictionary or an iterable of key-value pairs
another_dict = {"occupation": "Engineer"}
my_dict.update(another_dict)
# my_dict is now {'name': 'Alicia', 'age': 31, 'city': 'London', 'occupation': 'Engineer'}
```

### Removing Key-Value Pairs

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Using the del keyword
del my_dict["city"]
# my_dict is now {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}
# del my_dict["country"] # Raises KeyError if key doesn't exist

# Using the pop() method
# Removes the key and returns its value
age = my_dict.pop("age") # age is 30, my_dict is now {'name': 'Alice'}
# city = my_dict.pop("city") # Raises KeyError if key doesn't exist

# pop() with a default value to avoid KeyError
country = my_dict.pop("country", "Not Found") # country is "Not Found", my_dict is unchanged if "country" wasn't there

# Using popitem()
# Removes and returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair (LIFO since Python 3.7)
# Useful for iterating through and consuming dictionary items
my_dict = {"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}
item = my_dict.popitem() # item might be ('c', 3), my_dict is now {'a': 1, 'b': 2}

# Using clear()
# Removes all items from the dictionary
my_dict.clear() # my_dict is now {}
```

### Checking for Key Existence (Lookup)

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Using the 'in' operator (preferred)
is_name_present = "name" in my_dict  # True
is_city_present = "city" in my_dict  # False

# Using 'not in'
is_country_absent = "country" not in my_dict # True
```

### Iterating Through Dictionaries

```python
my_dict = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30, "city": "New York"}

# Iterating over keys (default iteration behavior)
print("Keys:")
for key in my_dict:
    print(key) # name, age, city

# Iterating over keys explicitly
print("\nKeys explicitly:")
for key in my_dict.keys():
    print(key) # name, age, city

# Iterating over values
print("\nValues:")
for value in my_dict.values():
    print(value) # Alice, 30, New York

# Iterating over key-value pairs (items)
print("\nKey-Value pairs:")
for key, value in my_dict.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}") # name: Alice, age: 30, city: New York
```

### Common Dictionary Methods Overview

- `clear()`: Removes all items.
- `copy()`: Returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.
- `fromkeys(seq[, value])`: Creates a new dictionary with keys from `seq` and values set to `value` (defaults to `None`).
  ```python
  keys = ['a', 'b', 'c']
  new_dict = dict.fromkeys(keys, 0) # {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0}
  ```
- `get(key[, default])`: Returns the value for `key` if `key` is in the dictionary, else `default`.
- `items()`: Returns a view object that displays a list of a dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.
- `keys()`: Returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys.
- `pop(key[, default])`: Removes `key` and returns its value. If `key` is not found, `default` is returned if given, otherwise `KeyError` is raised.
- `popitem()`: Removes and returns an arbitrary (key, value) pair.
- `setdefault(key[, default])`: If `key` is in the dictionary, returns its value. If not, inserts `key` with a value of `default` and returns `default` (defaults to `None`).
  ```python
  my_dict = {'a': 1}
  value_a = my_dict.setdefault('a', 0) # value_a is 1, my_dict is {'a': 1}
  value_b = my_dict.setdefault('b', 0) # value_b is 0, my_dict is {'a': 1, 'b': 0}
  ```
- `update([other])`: Updates the dictionary with the key/value pairs from `other`, overwriting existing keys.
- `values()`: Returns a view object that displays a list of all the values.

### Dictionary Comprehensions

Similar to list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions provide a concise way to create dictionaries.
Syntax: `{key_expr: value_expr for item in iterable if condition}`

```python
# Create a dictionary of squares
squares_dict = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
# squares_dict: {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}

# From existing lists
keys = ['name', 'age', 'city']
values = ['Bob', 25, 'Paris']
person_dict = {k: v for k, v in zip(keys, values)}
# person_dict: {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25, 'city': 'Paris'}

# With a condition
original_dict = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'd': 4}
even_values_dict = {k: v for k, v in original_dict.items() if v % 2 == 0}
# even_values_dict: {'b': 2, 'd': 4}

# Swapping keys and values (ensure values are unique and hashable if they become keys)
fruit_colors = {'apple': 'red', 'banana': 'yellow'}
color_fruits = {v: k for k, v in fruit_colors.items()}
# color_fruits: {'red': 'apple', 'yellow': 'banana'}
```

### Use Case Examples (from previous "Challenge")

1.  **Building a hash map from two lists:**

    ```python
    def build_hash_map(keys_list: list, values_list: list) -> dict:
        # Using zip and dict constructor is concise
        return dict(zip(keys_list, values_list))
        # Alternatively, using a dictionary comprehension:
        # return {keys_list[i]: values_list[i] for i in range(len(keys_list))}

    keys = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
    values = [0.5, 0.25, 0.75]
    price_map = build_hash_map(keys, values)
    print(price_map) # {'apple': 0.5, 'banana': 0.25, 'cherry': 0.75}
    ```

2.  **Getting values for a list of keys:**

    ```python
    def get_values_for_keys(hash_map: dict, keys_to_get: list) -> list:
        # Using a list comprehension
        return [hash_map[key] for key in keys_to_get]
        # Assuming all keys in keys_to_get exist in hash_map
        # If keys might be missing and you want a default:
        # return [hash_map.get(key, "N/A") for key in keys_to_get]

    fruit_prices = {'apple': 0.5, 'banana': 0.25, 'cherry': 0.75, 'date': 1.0}
    desired_fruits = ["banana", "date", "apple"]
    prices = get_values_for_keys(fruit_prices, desired_fruits)
    print(prices) # [0.25, 1.0, 0.5]
    ```

### Time Complexity of Basic Dictionary Operations

For Python's `dict` implementation (which uses a hash table):

- **Insertion**: Average `O(1)`, Worst case `O(n)` (due to hash collisions or resizing)
- **Access/Lookup**: Average `O(1)`, Worst case `O(n)`
- **Deletion**: Average `O(1)`, Worst case `O(n)`

The `O(n)` worst-case scenarios are rare in practice with good hash functions. For most practical purposes, dictionary operations are considered `O(1)`.
Heaps / Priority Queues 
(1 / 7)

Heap Push
Heaps (or priority queues) are a data structure that allow you to insert (push) and remove (pop) elements based on some priority associated with each element. In Python, a heap is a minimum heap by default, meaning that the element with the smallest priority is always at the top of the heap.

import heapq

heap = [] # min heap

heapq.heappush(heap, 3)
heapq.heappush(heap, 1)

print(heap[0])  # 1

heapq.heappush(heap, 0)

print(heap[0])  # 0
We first imported the heapq module, which contains functions for working with heaps.
We created an empty list called heap. Heaps are implemented as lists in Python.
We pushed the elements 3 and 1 onto the heap.
We accessed the element with the smallest priority, which is 1. The element with the smallest priority is always at index 0. This is the same as calling .top() in other languages.
We pushed the element 0 onto the heap.
We accessed the element with the smallest priority, which is now 0.
Challenge
Implement the function heap_push(heap: List[int], value: int) -> int that pushes the integer value onto the heap heap. The heap should be a min heap, meaning that the element with the smallest priority should be at index 0. After pushing the element, return the element with the smallest priority.

Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of heapq.heappush() is 
O
(
l
o
g
(
n
)
)
O(log(n)) where 
n
n is the number of elements in the heap.
The time complexity of accessing the element with the smallest priority is 
O
(
1
)
O(1), since indexing into a list is 
O
(
1
)
O(1).
The space complexity of a heap is 
O
(
n
)
O(n), where 
n
n is the number of elements in the heap.


Heaps / Priority Queues 
(2 / 7)

Heap Pop
Solved 
We can also remove elements from a heap using the heapq.heappop() function. This function removes the element with the smallest priority from the heap and returns it.

import heapq

heap = []

heapq.heappush(heap, "banana")
heapq.heappush(heap, "apple")
heapq.heappush(heap, "kiwi")

print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # apple
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # banana
print(heapq.heappop(heap))  # kiwi
We pushed the strings "banana", "apple", and "kiwi" onto the heap.
We popped the element with the smallest priority, which is "apple". By default, the priority of strings is determined by their lexicographical order, with smaller lexicographical strings having higher priority.
We popped the next element with the smallest priority, which is now "banana".
We popped the last element with the smallest priority, which is now "kiwi".
The heap is now empty. If we try to pop an element from an empty heap, we will get an IndexError.
Challenge
Implement the following function heap_pop(heap: List[int]) -> List[int] that pops all elements from the heap heap and returns them in a list in the order that they were popped. The heap should be a min heap, meaning that the elements with the smallest priority should be popped first.

Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of heapq.heappop() is 
O
(
l
o
g
(
n
)
)
O(log(n)) where 
n
n is the number of elements in the heap.


Heaps / Priority Queues 
(3 / 7)

Heapify
If we are given a list of elements up front, we can convert them into a heap using the heapq.heapify() function. This function rearranges the elements in the list so that they form a valid heap. The heap is a min heap by default, meaning that the element with the smallest priority is at index 0.

import heapq

heap = [4, 2, 5, 3, 1]

heapq.heapify(heap)

while heap:
    print(heapq.heappop(heap))
The output of this code will be:

1
2
3
4
5
We transformed the original list [4, 2, 5, 3, 1] into a heap using heapq.heapify(). We then popped all the elements from the heap in order of their priority.

Challenge
Implement the following functions:

heapify_strings(strings: List[str]) -> List[str] that takes a list of strings and returns a list of strings that have been transformed into a min heap.
heapify_integers(integers: List[int]) -> List[int] that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers that have been transformed into a min heap.
heap_sort(nums: List[int]) -> List[int] that takes a list of integers and returns a list of integers that have been sorted in ascending order. You should use the heapify function to transform the list into a heap before sorting it.
Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of heapq.heapify() is 
O
(
n
)
O(n) where 
n
n is the number of elements in the heap. This means it's more efficient than pushing elements onto the heap one by one, which would take 
O
(
n
l
o
g
(
n
)
)
O(nlog(n)) time.

Heaps / Priority Queues 
(4 / 7)

Max Heap
Solved 
Unfortunately, Python does not have a built-in max heap implementation. However, we can simulate a max heap by negating the values we insert into the heap. This way, the element with the largest priority (the smallest value) will be at the top of the heap.

Suppose we had a set of numbers [4, 2, 3, 5]. We can insert these numbers into a max heap by negating them and inserting them into a min heap. The negated numbers would be [-4, -2, -3, -5]. When we pop elements from the min heap, we would negate them again to get the original numbers.

import heapq

nums = [4, 2, 3, 5]
max_heap = []

for num in nums:
    heapq.heappush(max_heap, -num) # Negate the number

while max_heap:
    top = -heapq.heappop(max_heap) # Negate the number back
    print(top)
The output of this code will be:

5
4
3
2
We negated the numbers and pushed them onto the heap, which is technically implemented as a min heap.
This way the largest original number, 5, will be at the top of the heap after negation.
We popped the elements from the heap and negated them back to get the original numbers.
The popped values were -5, -4, -3, -2 before we negated them back to 5, 4, 3, 2.
Challenge
Implement the function get_reverse_sorted(nums: List[int]) -> List[int] which takes a list of integers and returns the integers in reverse sorted order. You should use the max heap technique described above to achieve this. The list of integers given is not necessarily a heap.

Custom Heap
Unfortunately, Python does not have a custom key parameter for the heapq module. This means that we cannot directly create a heap with custom priorities. However, we can simulate a custom heap by using a tuple as the element in the heap.

With tuples, Python will use the first element of the tuple as the priority. If two tuples have the same first element, Python will compare the second element of the tuples, and so on.

If we wanted to create a heap of integers by using the absolute value of each integer as the priority, we could use the following code:

import heapq

nums = [4, -2, 3, -5]
heap = []

for num in nums:
    pair = (abs(num), num)
    heapq.heappush(heap, pair)

while heap:
    pair = heapq.heappop(heap)
    original_num = pair[1]
    print(original_num)
The output of this code will be:

-2
3
4
-5
We pushed tuples onto the heap where the first element was the absolute value of the number and the second element was the original number. [(4, 4), (2, -2), (3, 3), (5, -5)].
The heap was a min heap based on the first element of each tuple.
We popped the tuples and printed the second element from each, which was the original number.

Heap N Smallest
Solved 
Heaps provide a very convenient way to find the smallest elements in a collection. For this we can use heapq.nsmallest():

import heapq

my_array = [1, 6, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8, 10, 2, 12]

heapq.nsmallest(3, my_array)  # returns [1, 2, 3]
heapq.nsmallest(5, my_array)  # returns [1, 2, 3, 5, 6]
heapq.nsmallest(1, my_array)  # returns [1]
We initialized an unsorted array my_array with some integers.
We called heapq.nsmallest(3, my_array). This returns the 3 smallest elements in my_array. The elements are returned in sorted order.
We also called heapq.nsmallest(5, my_array) which returns the 5 smallest elements in my_array.
We also called heapq.nsmallest(1, my_array) which returns the smallest element in my_array.
Challenge
Implement the following functions using heapq.nsmallest():

get_min_element(arr: List[int]) -> int that returns the smallest element in the list arr.
get_min_4_elements(arr: List[int]) -> List[int] that returns the 4 smallest elements in the list arr in increasing order.
get_min_2_elements(arr: List[int]) -> List[int] that returns the 2 smallest elements in the list arr in decreasing order.
Note: Assume all input arrays are unsorted and contain enough elements to return the required number of elements.

Time and Space Complexity
The time complexity of heapq.nsmallest() is 
O
(
m
l
o
g
(
n
)
)
O(mlog(n)) where 
n
n is the number of elements to return and 
m
m is the size of the input.
One way to implement nsmallest() is to iterate over the input and push each element onto a heap. We ensure the size of the heap is at most 
n
n by popping the largest element if the heap size exceeds 
n
n. Thus, we will use a max heap.

Heap N Largest
Solved 
We also have heapq.nlargest() to get the n largest elements in a collection.

import heapq

my_array = [1, 6, 3, 5, 7, 9, 8, 10, 2, 12]

heapq.nlargest(3, my_array)  # returns [12, 10, 9]
heapq.nlargest(5, my_array)  # returns [12, 10, 9, 8, 7]
heapq.nlargest(1, my_array)  # returns [12]
We initialized an unsorted array my_array with some integers.
We called heapq.nlargest(3, my_array). This returns the 3 largest elements in my_array. The elements are returned in decreasing order.
We also called heapq.nlargest(5, my_array) which returns the 5 largest elements in my_array in decreasing order.
We also called heapq.nlargest(1, my_array) which returns the largest element in my_array.
Challenge
Implement the following functions using heapq.nlargest():

get_max_element(arr: List[int]) -> int that returns the largest element in the list arr.
get_max_4_elements(arr: List[int]) -> List[int] that returns the 4 largest elements in the list arr in decreasing order.
get_max_2_elements(arr: List[int]) -> List[int] that returns the 2 largest elements in the list arr in increasing order.
Note: Assume all input arrays are unsorted and contain enough elements to return the required number of elements.
