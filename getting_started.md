What is Leetcode?
Leetcode is a platform that provides coding challenges and problems to help software engineers prepare for technical interviews. It has a large collection of problems that cover various topics, including data structures, algorithms, and system design. The platform also offers mock interviews, contests, and discussion forums to help users improve their coding skills.

Is Leetcode necessary?
In the strictest sense, no. You can get a job without doing Leetcode. There are specialized startups that care much more about practical experience and skills with particular technologies. However, most big tech comapnies ask LeetCode in their technical interviews. It is also good way to practice coding and problem solving skills.

What programminglanguage to start with?
Most entry level positions will give you a free choice to implement code in any language. If you know a language, stick with it. However, if you are not sure which language to choose, I would recommend Python. High-level, beginner friendly, plenty of resources, huge community, and a lot of libraries. Leetcode is not about syntac, but about what ds to use and what algorithms to use to solev the problem. It is beneficial to learn built-in libraries for dsa so you can focus on solving the problem, rather than implementing them from scratch.

How to start?
Familiarize yourslef with basic big o notation, time complexity, basic data structures and algorithms. You do not need to deep-dive into everything before starting, most of your understanding will develop naturally as you solve problems. There are plenty of online resources, do not spend time searching for the best one. Just pick one and stick with it.

For DS, refer to WIlliam Fiset's Youtube channel. He has a great playlist on data structures and algorithms. For algorithms, refer to Abdul Bari's Youtube channel.



How to study and prectice?
Start with one topic at a time. For example, start with arrays -> strings -> LinkedList -> Hash Tables -> Binary Trees. 
For each, understand the topic, understand how to implement it and then Solve 10-20 easy problems to build confidence, then move to medium problems say 5 and then move to next topic. Skip the hard ones for now, since most intevires focis on medium level prblems, that's where most of your time should be spent.

Leetcode provides lists like top 100 most liked, top 150 for interviews, top 50 for Google, etc. Solve all of them.

300-500 problems is a good number to aim for. 


How to solve problems?
Take your time - do not rush to increase your problem count. It is better to solve 5 problems with deep understanding than 50 problems with superficial understanding.
For every problem, try to reason why the solution works. WHat was the one insight that would have made you solve the problem?

Instead of focusing on indivdual problems, try to grasp the underlying pattern that connect similar problems.

Most Important Patterns:
1. Prefix Sum
2. Two Pointers
3. Sliding Window
4. Monotonic Stack
5. Top K Elements
6. Matrix Traversal
7. Modified Binary Search
8. Overlapping Intervals
9. Binary Tree Traversal
10. Depth First Search (DFS)
11. Breadth First Search (BFS)
12. Backtracking


How to approach a problem?
Read the probboem statement twice.
First pass reading - try to understand the problem statement first. Read it carefully and make sure you understand what is being asked - big picture.
Second pass reading - Then, try to understand special conditions and constraints that will allow you to optimize your solution.

Analyze i.o oexamples - Walkthorough the example step by step. Sometimes simply walking through will tell you what the solution is.



Use pen and paper to visualize - Many problems with trees and graphs are much easier to solve when you visualize them. Use pen and paper to draw the tree or graph and write down the values of the nodes, try to think through different input values and sizes.

start with brute force approach, do not expect to come up with the optimal solution right away. Start with brute force and then try to optimize it. This will help you understand the problem better and also help you come up with the optimal solution.

Now optimize your solution - 
1. Use unused information from the problem statement to optimize your solution. (Eg: Array is sorted -> Binary search and two pointers)
2. Precompute information - if calculations are repeated multiple times, precompute them using perfix sums and frequency counts.
3. Make time vs space tradooffs - Someitmes using extra mmemory like hashmaps or arrays can help you reduce time complexity. (Eg: Hashmap to store frequency counts, or a set to store unique values)
4. Do a DS brainstorm - run through all the DS and try to apply them to the problem. (Eg: Hashmap, Array, Set, Stack, Queue, LinkedList, Tree, Graph)
5. DO not overcomplicate - at every step, ask yourself can this be done simpler? Can I use a simpler data structure? Can I use a simpler algorithm? Can I use a simpler approach? 
6. Develop a habit to analyze the time and space complexity of your solution.

How much time to spend on a problem?
When you are startinf out, even easy problems can take a while to solve. You goal in the beginning should be to understand the problem deeply and develop intuition about ds and a. Ral progress happens when you spend time to think through and wrestle with the problem, spaced repitionns and practice.

Many problems require special tricks or patterns to solve. SPending a lot of time here is counter productive. If you are stuck on a problem for more than 30 minutes, read the solution. Read the topvoted solutions, try to understand why they work, reason how you can apply the same trick elsewhere and then try to implement them from scratch.

Maintain an excel sheet for all the problems you have solved by date, topic, approach etc. Add a column for why does this solution work and whhat was the key insight that solved this problem. Keep revising and revisiting.


Do not memorize:
Memorization will cause you to forget. In the interveiw the interviwer iwll ask you to expplain your solution, approach and delve deeper into the problem. If you have memorized, you will not be able to explain it. Instead, focus on the logic and probmlem solving.
