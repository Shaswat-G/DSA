# Important DSA topics for interviews:

Group into 3 things:
1. DS: Start with linear DS and then move to non-linear DS
   1. Linear - Array, strings, linked list, stack, queue, hash table
   2. Non-linear - tree, graph, binary search tree, heap, trie
2. ALgo - sorting, binary search, bit manipulation, tree traversal (in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order), graph traversal( DFS, BFS, topological sort, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford)
3. Problem Solving techniques - Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sum, fast and slow pointers, divide and conquer, greedy, recursion, backtracking, dynamic programming, top k elements. 

Focus on one topic at a time. Learning is easier and less tressful. 
Get to ta point where you understand the ins and outs, implement it from scratch and solve leetcode easy problems.


What's the right order for learning DSA?

How to start a new topic?
1. Start with the basics
   1. What is it?
   2. How is it represetned in code?
   3. What are the operations that can be performed on it?
   4. What are the time and space complexities of these operations?
2. Learn real life aoolications:
    1. Dijkstra for goodle maps, etc
    2. This will help you see hwere DSA and algos are actually used and implementation examples
3. Use pen and paper to visualize DS and A
    1. UUse pen and paper to draw diagrams and write pseudo code. 
4. Implement it from scratch
    1. reinforces your understanding and helps you remember it better.       
    2. Try implementing stacks with srras and linkedlists
5. Learn in-built libraries to learn how to use all their features and when to use them.
    1. For example, in python, learn how to use the heapq, collections library and when to use it. 
    1. Learn the libraries or built in functions that are available in your language of choice. 
    2. This will help you understand how to use them and when to use them.
6. Practice easy questions.

# How to master a dsa topic from scratch

1. Prioritize solving problems over theory. Real learning is in applying knowledge.
2. Challenge yourself - progressive overload - always be outsid your comfort zone. Easy -> Medium -> Hard
3. Focus on logic and uncderstanding, not memorization. Memorization works but does not allow you to egneralize the knowledge elsewhere
4. Use pen and paper to drawt it out.
5. THink in patterns - knowing patterns will quickly allow you to solve problems. Notic eht etechniques and approaches that come up often, group them together and practice them.
   
# Revision Strategy
1. Repitions - note everything down in an excel and revise it every week.
2. Make two lists on leet code - revision 1 (one you could not solve in one go) and revision 2 (one you could not solve revision 1))
3. Be consistent - it takes time - months to master.
