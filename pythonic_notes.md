# Pythonic Code: Elegant and Readable Patterns

## Unpacking and Packing

- **Unpacking:** Assign multiple variables at once from iterables.
  ```python
  a, b, c = (1, 2, 3)
  x, *rest = [10, 20, 30, 40]  # x=10, rest=[20,30,40]
  first, *_, last = [1, 2, 3, 4]  # first=1, last=4
  ```
- **Packing:** Use \*args and \*\*kwargs to collect positional and keyword arguments in functions.
  ```python
  def func(*args, **kwargs):
    pass
  ```

## Enumerate for Readability

- Use `enumerate()` to get both index and value when looping.
  ```python
  for idx, value in enumerate(my_list):
      print(idx, value)
  ```
- Improves clarity and avoids manual index tracking.

## Zip for Parallel Iteration

- Use `zip()` to iterate over multiple iterables in parallel.
  ```python
  for a, b in zip(list1, list2):
      print(a, b)
  ```
- Useful for combining, comparing, or processing paired data.

## Chained Comparisons

- Python allows concise chained comparisons:
  ```python
  if 0 < x < 10:
      ...
  ```

## Min/Max Shortcuts

- Use `min()` and `max()` to constrain values elegantly:
  ```python
  transactions = max(0, transactions)  # Never negative
  transactions = min(100, transactions)  # Never above 100
  ```
- Prefer these over verbose if-statements for bounds checking.

## General Tips

- Prefer list comprehensions for concise transformations.
- Use generator expressions for memory efficiency with large data.
- Leverage built-in functions (`any`, `all`, `sum`, `sorted`, etc.) for clarity and performance.
- Write expressive, readable code—avoid unnecessary loops and manual bookkeeping.
